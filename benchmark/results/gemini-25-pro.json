  "summary": "## Goal\n1.  Review and discuss Josh's health/biohacking stack, especially MOTS-c peptide history and current protocol\n2.  Plan and execute IVF logistics with Almond Blossoms (Dubai) + Orchid Health (NJ) for embryo genetic screening\n3.  Draft legal documents required by Almond Blossoms clinic for IVF without Josh physically present\n4.  Investigate Rivalry Corp (TSXV: RVLY) \u2014 Canadian esports betting operator in distress/selling\n5.  Monitor iGaming M&A market for buy/sell opportunities relevant to Josh's grey-market operation\n6.  Analyze latest Grok social intel signals and translate them into actionable business moves\n7.  Security audit and hardening of OpenClaw gateway + Rasputin server infrastructure\n8.  Investigate potential umbilical hernia / diastasis recti \u2014 book surgeon appointment\n9.  Diagnose OpenClaw gateway pipeline behavior \u2014 rate limiting, model switching/failover frequency, cron lane health\n10. Set up gog OAuth for josh@cartu.com and enable all Google Workspace APIs for full CLI access\n11. Check Google AI subscriptions on josh@cartu.com and j@mail99.me; configure Antigravity provider for free Claude Opus access\n12. Deep-dive all Opus 4.6 provider rate limits and optimize pipeline fallback order\n13. Set up Opus pipeline monitoring observatory \u2014 probe every 30 min, daily morning report, optimize for 1 week (Feb 17-24)\n14. Star Citizen account evaluation \u2014 help Josh with RSI hangar valuation / account details\n15. **Research tai chi classes/instructors in Toronto for Dad (Lazar) post-lung transplant** \u2014 both studio classes and in-home instructors, ideally with post-surgical/respiratory rehab experience. PINNED until Lazar is a few days from hospital release.\n16. **Build production-quality Manus competitor for Russian/CIS market** \u2014 architecture for millions, ship for 5 users. NOT a hack/Frankenstein of existing pieces. Build once, scale later. Use parallel OpenCode + Claude Code + sub-agents + local GPU inference to build in ~5-7 days.\n17. **Draft outreach to Extradition Law Firm (ELF)** for Interpol Red Notice defense + Russian residency protection\n18. **Resolve \u0412\u041d\u0416 (blue book) conversion** \u2014 convert old-format (2028 expiration) permanent residence permit to new indefinite format via migration lawyer (Tarasenko)\n19. **Evaluate Ashley McDonald's Rasputin Production architecture** \u2014 production-grade affiliate platform already in repo, assess readiness for deployment on existing K3s cluster\n20. **Investigate OpenClaw adaptive thinking support** \u2014 determine whether OpenClaw 2026.2.15 translates `thinkingDefault: \"high\"` to new Anthropic adaptive thinking API format (`thinking: {type: \"adaptive\"}` + `output_config: {effort}`) or still uses deprecated `budget_tokens`\n21. **Fix OpenCode Black as OpenClaw provider/fallback** \u2014 configure proper provider definition and verify working as pipeline fallback\n22. **Run full 20-category Grok social intel scan** \u2014 all forums/topics across casino regulation, brand monitoring, affiliate/traffic, payments, player sentiment, new markets, M&A, AI, crypto, geopolitics, cars, health, gaming, luxury, gadgets, audio, Russia/expat, VR/XR\n23. **Publish \"The Cartu Method\" for context compaction** \u2014 A systematic evaluation framework (Speed, Fidelity, Efficiency triad) with benchmarks, a website, and a plugin.\n24. **Plan wedding ceremony/party** for 50-80 guests (Moscow vs. St. Petersburg).\n\n## Constraints & Preferences\n- Josh cannot travel internationally (Interpol Red Notice \u2014 binary options fraud case)\n- Legal documents must NOT reference criminal matters, Interpol, or specific jurisdictions \u2014 keep vague (\"ongoing legal proceedings\")\n- Sasha doesn't want to do IVF in Mexico (Orchid's other international option)\n- Josh's sperm is stored at NGC Clinic, St. Petersburg, Russia \u2014 export restrictions and sanctions complicate shipping\n- Josh operates grey-market iGaming brands (WikiLuck, BetOBet, 24Slots, BattleBet, Pure Casino, Peer Casino \u2014 INSINE KFT/NewEra B.V., Cura\u00e7ao licensed)\n- **Brazil is NOT a primary market** \u2014 focus is English-speaking grey markets (Canada, NZ, India, Northern Europe likely). Need casino admin panel access to verify player geo/language breakdown.\n- **No SecureClaw install** \u2014 Josh rejected the Adversa AI third-party security tool; manual hardening preferred over behavioral context tax\n- Server is behind NAT (192.168.1.94, router 192.168.1.1) \u2014 public IP 193.186.162.74 shows ports filtered; LAN exposure only, not internet exposure\n- Only Josh's wife has WiFi access \u2014 LAN attack surface is minimal\n- **gog keyring**: file backend, `GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD=***PASSWORD_REDACTED***`, `GOG_ACCOUNT=josh@cartu.com` (both exported in `~/.bashrc`)\n- **OAuth client \"Second Brain Health\"** is set to **Internal** user type \u2014 only cartu.com org users can auth. Does NOT support classroom, chat, cloud-platform, contacts.other.readonly, or directory.readonly scopes.\n- **Morning briefing preference**: Josh wants pipeline health monitoring delivered as part of his morning casino updates \u2014 NOT as separate alerts. Bundle all into one morning shot.\n- **Pipeline cost priority**: Flat-fee subs first (Max20, OpenCode Black \u2014 already paying), then free (Antigravity), then per-token last. anthropic-direct is absolute worst case (\"costs a fortune\").\n- **.env file keys are STALE** \u2014 auth-profiles.json (`/home/josh/.openclaw/agents/main/agent/auth-profiles.json`) is the real source of truth for API keys. `.env` ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and OPENROUTER_API_KEY differ from auth-profiles.\n- **Rewrite tone preference**: When drafting messages for Josh to send to his brothers, write as one paragraph, no dashes (\u2014), no AI-style formatting. Older brother telling younger brothers how it is.\n- **Manus competitor: build once, scale later** \u2014 Architecture decisions that are impossible to change later (tenant isolation, event protocol, API contract, stateless backend, interface-based services) must be right from day 1. Everything else (monitoring, CI/CD, CDN, rate limiting, billing) can wait.\n- **Manus competitor: $0 build + $0 run** \u2014 OpenCode Black ($200/mo flat, already paying) for build. Ollama Qwen 72B + Coder 30B on GPUs for product inference. Zero per-token API costs.\n- **Grey-market regulatory news is NOT a fire drill** \u2014 worth a mention in intel digests, not \ud83d\udea8 red alerts with action items. Josh knows he's grey, always has been. Curacao blocks are \"just Tuesday.\"\n- **Don't repeat the same analysis/intel multiple times in one day** \u2014 Josh explicitly called this out 3 times. Grok scanner dedup must be fixed.\n- **ELF draft is for review only** \u2014 Josh will confirm if/when to send. Do NOT send autonomously.\n\n## Progress\n### Done\n- [x] Reviewed MOTS-c history, mechanisms, and Josh's previous dosing (28mg/week, 3-4x standard)\n- [x] Updated Josh's health profile: new stack is TB-500, BPC-157, Somatropin 1iu/day, TRT 10mg/day (~70mg/week), Mounjaro 7.5mg/week \u2014 committed to memory\n- [x] Confirmed Josh & Sasha married January 14, 2026 in Moscow \u2014 committed to memory\n- [x] Assessed fertility impact of 2 weeks back on TRT \u2014 pipeline sperm still viable, not yet fully suppressed\n- [x] Confirmed 6 portions of sperm banked; IVF target April 2027 cycle (late March/early April retrieval)\n- [x] Drafted legal restrictions letter \u2192 `/home/josh/.openclaw/workspace/drafts/almond-blossoms-legal-restriction-letter.md`\n- [x] Drafted notarized consent letter \u2192 `/home/josh/.openclaw/workspace/drafts/almond-blossoms-consent-letter.md`\n- [x] Sent both drafts to Josh via Telegram (messages 10922, 10923 to chat 1031217602)\n- [x] Researched Russia\u2192Dubai sperm shipping options (IVF Couriers hand-carry service, Sasha hand-carry as backup)\n- [x] Researched Russia\u2192US embryo biopsy shipping \u2014 confirmed near-impossible\n- [x] Identified Rivalry Corp (TSXV: RVLY) winding down operations as of Feb 13, 2026\n- [x] Committed M&A monitoring directive to memory\n- [x] Analyzed latest Grok intel scans and mapped signals to Josh's operation\n- [x] Confirmed OpenClaw version 2026.2.15 (latest on stable channel)\n- [x] Ran `openclaw status` \u2014 built-in security audit found **3 CRITICAL + 2 WARN + 1 INFO** issues\n- [x] Retrieved full gateway configuration via `gateway config.get`\n- [x] Researched Adversa AI / SecureClaw \u2014 recommended against installing\n- [x] **OpenClaw security hardening \u2014 all 6 priority fixes applied** (chmod 700, Telegram allowFrom locked, elevated exec locked, trustedProxies fixed, Discord disabled, API key moved to .env)\n- [x] **Phase 1 server hardening \u2014 internal services bound to localhost:** Second brain (7777), Embedding server (8003), Reranker (8006 already ok), ttyd (7681 \u2014 **CRITICAL: was exposing bash shell on 0.0.0.0 with plaintext creds**), ADB (5037 killed)\n- [x] **Full Rasputin server audit completed**: 58 services on 0.0.0.0 inventoried.

Also found on UK FCDO professional services directory and Justia.\n- [x] **Drafted full inquiry email to ELF/Kshevitsky** \u2014 covers Interpol Red Notice, US indictment (Case No. 8:21-cr-00331-PX, D. Md., Aug 25 2021), binary options fraud charges (2013-2017 scheme), 2024 St. Petersburg detention, brothers' Dubai release (US never sent extradition docs), requests for extradition defense + Red Notice challenge + \u0412\u041d\u0416 protection. Mentions existing US counsel (ArentFox Schiff) and Israeli counsel. Professional tone. Draft shown to Josh for approval.\n- [x] **Retrieved and analyzed Ashley McDonald's Rasputin Production architecture** \u2014 fetched full doc via `gog docs cat`, saved to `/home/josh/.openclaw/workspace/reference/rasputin-production-ashley-spec.md`.\n- [x] **Confirmed Ashley's repo exists and is active** \u2014 Bitbucket Server at `git.shuhari.tools/projects/RAS/repos/workspace/browse` (behind SSO). Commits by Ashley McDonald on Jan 9-10, 2026.\n- [x] **Confirmed Rick = Ashley McDonald** \u2014 Rick (@rick_the_alien, rick@mail99.me) is Ashley McDonald, Josh's CTO\n- [x] **Provided architecture analysis to Josh** \u2014 PostgREST and event outbox pattern praised, concerns raised about missing AI layer, K8s operational overhead, Knative premature for current scale, no CI/CD/timeline in spec\n- [x] **Clarified Tarasenko is migration lawyer, not developer** \u2014 Josh needs him for \u0412\u041d\u0416 blue book conversion, not Rasputin platform\n- [x] **Recommended Tarasenko for \u0412\u041d\u0416 conversion** \u2014 cheaper than ELF for administrative procedure, keep ELF as backup if \u041c\u0412\u0414 flags Red Notice\n- [x] **Confirmed Opus 4.6 already has adaptive thinking** \u2014 launched with it on Feb 5, 2026. Sonnet 4.6 also dropped today (Feb 17). Josh's config has `thinking=high` which locks to max; adaptive would let model decide per-request.\n- [x] **Researched Anthropic adaptive thinking API** \u2014 new format: `thinking: {type: \"adaptive\"}` + `output_config: {effort: \"medium\"|\"low\"|\"high\"|\"max\"}`. Old `budget_tokens` is deprecated on Opus 4.6/Sonnet 4.6. `max` effort is Opus 4.6 only.\n- [x] **Pipeline monitoring Day 1 data analysis COMPLETED** \u2014 72 probes over 8 hours (Feb 17, 15:17-23:18 MSK). Results: anthropic-direct 17/18 up (1 \"Overloaded\"), avg 2,931ms; openrouter 18/18 up, avg 3,027ms; opencode-zen 0/18 (16 down + 2 auth err); google-antigravity 0/18 (proxy not running).\n- [x] **Retrieved OpenClaw system status** \u2014 running on Linux with 86 active sessions, Telegram and WhatsApp channels enabled, default model claude-opus-4-6\n- [x] **Retrieved full openclaw.json config** \u2014 confirmed `opencode/claude-opus-4-6` was first fallback (aliased \"Zen Opus\") in both main agent and subagent fallback chains\n- [x] **Confirmed OpenCode provider misconfiguration in openclaw.json** \u2014 previously no `opencode` provider defined in `models.providers` section, just a dangling model entry\n- [x] **Spawned full 20-category Grok social intel scan** \u2014 sub-agent running all topics: casino regulation, brand monitoring, affiliate/traffic, payments, player sentiment, new markets, M&A, AI models, agents, GPU inference, crypto, geopolitics, cars, health/biohacking, gaming, luxury, gadgets, audio, Russia/expat, VR/XR\n- [x] **MAJOR CORRECTION: OpenCode Black API ACTUALLY WORKS as external endpoint** \u2014 Previous investigation tested WRONG URLs (`opencode.ai/api/v1/`, `api.opencode.ai/v1/`). The correct endpoint is `https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/messages` (Anthropic Messages API format). Confirmed working: HTTP 200, valid Opus 4.6 response, cost $0 (flat rate). 33 models available.\n- [x] **OpenCode Black rate limits researched**: $200/mo 20X plan provides ~$200+/week worth of Opus usage; users report 6-8hr/day of heavy coding for a full week before hitting weekly cap. Weekly quota reset. **~8-10x more capacity than Antigravity.**\n- [x] **Antigravity rate limits confirmed**: ~5 hours of Opus before quota hit, weekly cooldown (users locked out for full weeks). Google tightening limits since Jan 2026.\n- [x] **OpenCode provider PROPERLY configured in openclaw.json** \u2014 added `opencode` provider definition with `baseUrl: \"https://opencode.ai/zen/v1\"`, `api: \"anthropic-messages\"`, API key from env. Model `opencode/claude-opus-4-6` now routes correctly.\n- [x] **New pipeline fallback order APPLIED via gateway config**:\n  1.  Max20 (primary)\n  2.  OpenCode Black (1st fallback) \u2014 $200/mo flat, ~8-10x Antigravity capacity\n  3.  Antigravity (2nd fallback) \u2014 free, ~5hr/week\n  4.  OpenRouter (3rd fallback) \u2014 per-token $15/$75\n  5.  anthropic-direct (4th fallback) \u2014 per-token, last resort\n  6.  Sonnet 4.6 (5th fallback) \u2014 downgrade\n- [x] **OpenCode Zen endpoint fully verified**: `opencode.ai/zen/v1/messages` with Black API key, 33 models, Opus 4.6 at ~2,616ms latency, cost $0\n- [x] **Repaired and restarted Antigravity proxy on port 4152.** The proxy was killed during a server reboot and has now been restarted (PID 1247891). All 6 pipeline providers are now active.\n- [x] **Set reminder for surgeon appointment** for Thursday, February 20, 2026 at 09:00 MSK.\n- [x] **Analyzed Dexcom G7 data**, confirmed post-lunch glucose spikes (180+), and recommended moving Mounjaro injection from Sunday evening to Thursday evening/Friday morning to better cover the problematic days.\n- [x] **Drafted and sent instructions to Sasha via WhatsApp** for getting an apostille on the Russian marriage certificate from the Ministry of Justice.\n- [x] **Sent Manus competitor SPEC.md to Josh on Telegram for review.**\n- [x] **Grok scanner deduplication fix APPLIED.** The script at `/home/josh/.openclaw/workspace/tools/grok_social_intel.py` now hashes findings and compares against a history file (`/workspace/data/scans/last_delivered.json`) to only surface new items.\n\n### In Progress\n- [ ] **Run full compaction benchmark suite** across local models (Qwen 72B, Coder 30B) and cloud models (Gemini Flash, etc.) to evaluate speed vs. quality.\n- [ ] **Build \"The Cartu Method\" website** (cartu.rasputin.studio) to publish the compaction research, benchmarks, and plugin. A sub-agent has been spawned for the build.\n- [ ] **Manus competitor build \u2014 Awaiting review.** Phase 0 specs (SPEC.md, CONTRACTS.md) are complete and sent to Josh. Awaiting his review and green light to start Stage 1 build.\n- [ ] **Week-long pipeline optimization** \u2014 monitoring running, daily analysis + morning reports active. Day 1 baseline captured. Runs through Feb 24.\n- [ ] **Tai chi for Dad (Lazar) \u2014 PINNED.** Initial research complete, options for studios and private in-home instructors identified. Awaiting Dad's final post-release address to sort by proximity and provide final recommendations.\n- [ ] **ELF email draft awaiting Josh's confirmation to send.** Draft is complete but **on hold** pending Josh's call with his US counsel, Michelle Shapiro.\n- [ ] **\u0412\u041d\u0416 blue book conversion** \u2014 Josh needs migration lawyer (Tarasenko) to convert old-format (2028 expiration) permit to indefinite format. Josh hasn't provided Tarasenko's contact info yet.\n- [ ] **Investigating OpenClaw adaptive thinking translation** \u2014 searching OpenClaw 2026.2.15 dist JS files (`image-B1DRN441.js`, `reply-BhWxw1_E.js`, `cron-cli-CeKWtNhW.js`, `gateway-cli-CRiBIFy7.js`) to determine whether `thinkingDefault: \"high\"` gets translated to new adaptive API format or still uses deprecated `budget_tokens`.\n- [ ] **Full 20-category Grok scan running** \u2014 sub-agent spawned, compiling results + TL;DR executive summary, auto-announce when done\n- [ ] Josh needs to forward draft documents to his lawyer (Michelle Shapiro at ArentFox Schiff or Israeli counsel)\n- [ ] Rivalry Corp acquisition opportunity \u2014 no financials deep-dive done yet\n- [ ] Phase 2 server hardening: Docker compose fixes for PostgreSQL 5432, MySQL 3306 \u2192 bind to 127.0.0.1\n- [ ] Phase 3 server hardening: code-server 3113, OpenCode 9999, Netdata 19999 \u2192 bind to Tailscale IP or add iptables rules\n- [ ] Tailscale SSH enablement: `sudo tailscale set --ssh` then bind SSH to localhost + Tailscale IP only\n\n### Blocked\n- **Casino admin panel access needed** \u2014 no URLs or credentials stored on Rasputin; Josh will provide access when ready, explicitly instructed not to ping Ashley.\n- **Star Citizen RSI login credentials not in memory** \u2014 may need Josh to provide if live scrape is needed\n- **jarvis-postgres container broken** \u2014 `database \"jarvis\" does not exist` / `role \"postgres\" does not exist`. Real creds: DB=`jarvis_vault`, user=`jarvis`, password=`***REDACTED***`. Needs fix before ALFIE backend can connect to Postgres. (~30 min fix)\n- **Tarasenko contact info unknown** \u2014 Josh hasn't provided who Tarasenko is or how to reach them\n- **git.shuhari.tools requires SSO auth** \u2014 can't audit Ashley's repo code quality without read access\n\n## Key Decisions\n- **Dubai over Mexico/Russia for IVF**: Almond Blossoms is confirmed Orchid partner, logistics sorted, only legal letter needed\n- **Keep legal disclosure vague**: \"Ongoing legal proceedings\" only \u2014 no Interpol/criminal references\n- **Stay on TRT**: 6 banked sperm portions sufficient for ICSI\n- **Michelle Shapiro recommended** over Israeli lawyer for the legal letter\n- **Don't install SecureClaw**: Manual hardening preferred \u2014 behavioral skill conflicts with autonomy-first config\n- **Don't change sandbox.mode or elevatedDefault**: Both intentionally set by Josh\n- **Security postponed to tomorrow morning**: Phase 1 complete, Phases 2-3 deferred\n- **Brazil licensing deprioritized**: Not a primary market. Focus on English-speaking grey markets.\n- **josh@cartu.com is the primary email**: Not j@mail99.me \u2014 gog configured for cartu.com\n- **Manual OAuth token exchange over gog interactive flow**: gog's PTY-based `--manual` auth kept failing. Direct curl token exchange + `gog auth tokens import` worked reliably.\n- **Gmail-only initial auth, incremental scope expansion**: `--services all` caused invalid_scope. Started with Gmail, adding incrementally.\n- **Google AI Ultra NOT worth investigating**: Consumer subscription for Gemini web UI, does NOT include free API access.\n- **Pipeline cost ordering: flat-fee first, free second, per-token last**: Max20 ($200/mo) \u2192 OpenCode Black ($200/mo) \u2192 Antigravity (free) \u2192 OpenRouter (per-token) \u2192 anthropic-direct (per-token, absolute last resort).\n- **OpenCode is \"Black\" tier ($200/mo), not free \"Zen\"**: Josh clarified he has the paid subscription.\n- **j@mail99.me for Antigravity, not josh@cartu.com**: j@mail99.me is the account with the Antigravity subscription.\n- **Antigravity uses `claude-opus-4-6-thinking` model ID**: The non-thinking `claude-opus-4-6` returns 404 on Antigravity.\n- **Manus competitor: build properly from scratch, not hack existing pieces together**: Josh explicitly rejected wiring ALFIE UI + ALFIE backend + Russian Manus orchestrator. Wants clean architecture built for millions, MVP for 5.\n- **Manus competitor: architecture for millions, ship for 5**: Day-1 decisions that can't change later: tenant isolation, event protocol schema, API contract, stateless backend, interface-based services. Day-N swaps: Docker\u2192K8s, local disk\u2192S3, Ollama\u2192vLLM, JWT\u2192OAuth/SSO, direct WebSocket\u2192Redis Streams.\n- **Manus competitor stack**: Next.js 15 + shadcn/ui + Tailwind + Zustand (frontend), FastAPI (backend), LangGraph (orchestrator), PostgreSQL (event-sourced sessions), Qdrant (per-user vector memory), Redis (cache/pubsub), Docker (sandbox per session), Ollama (Qwen 72B + Coder 30B).\n- **Strip enterprise bloat from Russian Manus for MVP**: No Keycloak, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, OTel, MinIO. Simple JWT auth + file storage on disk.\n- **Layered sequential build over parallel waves**: Deep reassessment concluded parallel agents are bad at integration (\"the glue IS the product\"). 4 sequential stages, each using 3-4 parallel agents with manual integration between stages.\n- **Keep Russian Manus backend, rebuild frontend from scratch**: Backend LangGraph orchestrator is solid and will be extended. Frontend rebuilt as clean split-screen Manus UX.\n- **Realistic timeline: 5-7 days for working MVP, not 24 hours**: Integration, debugging, frontend polish, and WebSocket streaming reliability are hard problems that can't be parallelized.\n- **Filesystem-as-memory for multi-day multi-agent build**: SPEC.md, BUILD_STATE.md, CONTRACTS.md, decisions/, tasks/, shared/, logs/.\n- **Local inference for CIS prototype**: Ollama Qwen 72B + Qwen Coder 30B on existing GPUs, $0/mo per-user cost.\n- **Per-user Qdrant isolation needed**: Current `second_brain_v2` is one big collection \u2014 each prototype user needs own namespace or collection.\n- **$20-35 total build cost**: Leveraging OpenCode Black flat, Claude Code ~$5-10, Qwen 72B $0.\n- **Use Tarasenko (migration lawyer) for \u0412\u041d\u0416 conversion, not ELF**: Administrative document swap at \u041c\u0412\u0414 doesn't need extradition rates. ELF is backup if \u041c\u0412\u0414 flags the Red Notice.\n- **Use Ashley's existing repo, don't rebuild with Tarasenko**: Ashley has the Rasputin Production codebase in a working repo with active commits (Jan 9-10, 2026), battle-tested pg-event-publisher, and designed the architecture.\n- **Rasputin Production \u2260 Manus competitor**: These are two separate projects.\n- **Regulatory intel calibration**: Mention regulatory moves in digests but don't treat them as fire drills.\n- **OpenCode Black IS a valid pipeline fallback**: Previous investigation was WRONG \u2014 tested incorrect URLs. The correct endpoint `https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/messages` (Anthropic Messages API) works with the Black API key. HTTP 200, cost $0, 33 models available. Previous conclusion (\"CLI-only, no external API\") was erroneous.\n- **OpenCode Black positioned as 1st fallback (above Antigravity)**: ~8-10x more Opus capacity than Antigravity. Weekly quota vs Antigravity's ~5hr/week. Josh confirmed: \"we'll have higher limits with OpenCode Black.\"\n- **Antigravity demoted to 3rd in fallback chain**: Josh said \"put that third in line for now\" \u2014 lower capacity (~5hr/week), Google tightening limits.\n- **Hold Star Citizen account**: Collector-tier status (Legatus Navium) and original backer perks make it a valuable long-term asset.
