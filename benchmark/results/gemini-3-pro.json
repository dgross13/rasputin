  "summary": "## Goal\n1. Review and discuss Josh's health/biohacking stack, especially MOTS-c peptide history and current protocol\n2. Plan and execute IVF logistics with Almond Blossoms (Dubai) + Orchid Health (NJ) for embryo genetic screening\n3. Draft legal documents required by Almond Blossoms clinic for IVF without Josh physically present\n4. Monitor iGaming M&A market (Rivalry Corp) and regulatory landscape (Brazil)\n5. Analyze latest Grok social intel signals and translate them into actionable business moves\n6. Security audit and hardening of OpenClaw gateway + Rasputin server infrastructure\n7. Investigate potential umbilical hernia / diastasis recti \u2014 **Surgeon appointment booked Feb 20**\n8. Diagnose OpenClaw gateway pipeline behavior \u2014 rate limiting, model switching/failover frequency, cron lane health\n9. Set up Opus pipeline monitoring observatory \u2014 probe every 30 min, daily morning report, optimize for 1 week (Feb 17-24)\n10. **Star Citizen account evaluation \u2014 DECISION: HOLD account (Legatus Navium status)**\n11. **Research tai chi classes/instructors in Toronto for Dad (Lazar) post-lung transplant** \u2014 Dad currently at Toronto Western Hospital, treating fungal infection.\n12. **Build production-quality Manus competitor for Russian/CIS market** \u2014 Phase 0 Spec sent to Josh. Awaiting review.\n13. **Draft outreach to Extradition Law Firm (ELF)** \u2014 **HELD** pending consultation with Michelle Shapiro.\n14. **Resolve \u0412\u041d\u0416 (blue book) conversion** \u2014 convert old-format (2028 expiration) permanent residence permit to new indefinite format via migration lawyer (Tarasenko)\n15. **Fix Grok intel scan deduplication** \u2014 **FIXED** via hash check in `grok_social_intel.py`.\n16. **Launch \"The Cartu Method\" Website** \u2014 `cartu.rasputin.studio`. Showcase compaction methodology (Speed \u00d7 Fidelity \u00d7 Efficiency), benchmarks, and OpenClaw plugin.\n17. **Wedding Planning** \u2014 Preliminary research for Moscow vs. St. Petersburg, 50-80 guests, elegant/non-ostentatious.\n\n## Constraints & Preferences\n- Josh cannot travel internationally (Interpol Red Notice \u2014 binary options fraud case)\n- Legal documents must NOT reference criminal matters, Interpol, or specific jurisdictions \u2014 keep vague (\"ongoing legal proceedings\")\n- Sasha doesn't want to do IVF in Mexico (Orchid's other international option)\n- Josh's sperm is stored at NGC Clinic, St. Petersburg, Russia \u2014 export restrictions and sanctions complicate shipping\n- Josh operates grey-market iGaming brands (WikiLuck, BetOBet, 24Slots, BattleBet, Pure Casino, Peer Casino \u2014 INSINE KFT/NewEra B.V., Cura\u00e7ao licensed)\n- **Brazil is NOT a primary market** \u2014 Regulatory changes (licensing by Q3 2026, ~$5M cost) are worth monitoring but not a fire drill.\n- **No SecureClaw install** \u2014 Josh rejected the Adversa AI third-party security tool; manual hardening preferred over behavioral context tax\n- Server is behind NAT (192.168.1.94, router 192.168.1.1) \u2014 public IP 193.186.162.74 shows ports filtered; LAN exposure only, not internet exposure\n- Only Josh's wife has WiFi access \u2014 LAN attack surface is minimal\n- **gog keyring**: file backend, `GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD=***PASSWORD_REDACTED***`, `GOG_ACCOUNT=josh@cartu.com` (both exported in `~/.bashrc`)\n- **Pipeline cost priority**: Flat-fee subs first (Max20, OpenCode Black), then free (Antigravity), then per-token last.\n- **.env file keys are STALE** \u2014 auth-profiles.json is the real source of truth for API keys.\n- **Rewrite tone preference**: When drafting messages for Josh to send to his brothers, write as one paragraph, no dashes (\u2014), no AI-style formatting.\n- **Manus competitor: build once, scale later** \u2014 Architecture decisions that are impossible to change later must be right from day 1.\n- **Star Citizen Decision**: Hold account. Do not sell.\n- **ELF email draft is for review only** \u2014 **HELD** indefinitely. Do NOT send.\n- **Compaction Strategy**: \"The Cartu Method\" (Speed, Fidelity, Efficiency). Compaction is infrastructure, not conversation.\n\n## Progress\n### Done\n- [x] **Antigravity Proxy Fixed**: Restarted `google-antigravity-proxy` on port 4152 (PID 1247891). Verified live via health check and test call.\n- [x] **Star Citizen Analysis**: Legatus Navium rank, $34k spent. Decision: **HOLD**.\n- [x] **Brazilian Regulation Intel**: Draft leaked. Cura\u00e7ao operators need license/partner by Q3 2026. Cost ~$5M. Impact: BetOBet BR traffic (~12%). Status: Deprioritized.\n- [x] **Manus Competitor Spec**: Phase 0 (SPEC.md, 47 pages) sent to Josh via Telegram.\n- [x] **Surgeon Appointment Booked**: Thursday, Feb 20, 2026 at 09:00 MSK (suspected umbilical hernia).\n- [x] **Glucose Analysis**: Dexcom data pulled via ADB. Confirmed post-lunch spikes (12:00-14:00) to 180+. Correlated with Mounjaro timing (Sunday injection wearing off by Friday). Recommendation: Move injection to Thu/Fri.\n- [x] **Marriage Certificate Apostille**: Instructions for Sasha (Ministry of Justice, Moscow) written in Russian and sent via WhatsApp.\n- [x] **Compaction Benchmark**: Gemini 3 Flash (18.3s) vs Qwen 72B (slow). Conclusion: Local 72B too slow for compaction. Cloud Flash or small local model preferred.\n- [x] **Grok Scanner Dedup Fix**: Implemented hash check in `/home/josh/.openclaw/workspace/tools/grok_social_intel.py`. Verified.\n- [x] **Dad (Lazar) Update**: Bronchoscopy confirmed **fungal infection**. Treatment: Voriconazole. Hospital 2-3 more weeks.\n- [x] **Tai Chi Research**: Initial search for Toronto Western Hospital / Hillcrest area. Studios + private instructors identified.\n- [x] **IVF Documents**: Drafted consent + legal restrictions letters. Sent to Josh.\n- [x] **OpenCode Black**: Verified working as 1st fallback ($200/mo flat).\n- [x] **Pipeline Monitoring**: Day 1 baseline captured.\n\n### In Progress\n- [ ] **\"The Cartu Method\" Website**: Building `cartu.rasputin.studio`. Dark research lab vibe. Stack: Next.js 15 + Tailwind + Recharts.\n- [ ] **Compaction Plugin Packaging**: Packaging the offloader for OpenClaw distribution.\n- [ ] **Manus Competitor Phase 0 Review**: Josh reviewing SPEC.md.\n- [ ] **Dad's Tai Chi**: Waiting for final post-release address to filter instructors by proximity.\n- [ ] **Sasha Apostille**: Sasha handling Ministry of Justice visit.\n- [ ] **Pipeline Monitoring**: Running through Feb 24.\n- [ ] **\u0412\u041d\u0416 Conversion**: Need Tarasenko contact info.\n\n### Blocked\n- **ELF Email**: Held pending Josh's call with Michelle Shapiro.\n- **Casino Admin Access**: User will provide credentials later. Do not ping Ashley.\n\n## Key Decisions\n- **Star Citizen**: **HOLD**. Do not sell. Account value ($34k spent, Legatus status) likely to spike at 1.0 release.\n- **Medical**: Move Mounjaro injection to **Thursday/Friday** to cover weekend lunch spikes.\n- **Compaction**: \"The Cartu Method\" is a publishable methodology. Build a website to showcase it.\n- **ELF Email**: **HOLD**. Coordinate with US counsel (Michelle Shapiro) before engaging Russian lawyers to avoid conflict of strategy.\n- **Wedding**: Preliminary plan: 50-80 people. Josh prefers St. Petersburg (White Nights), Sasha prefers Moscow. Budget flexible.\n- **Dad's Recovery**: Monitor Voriconazole + Prednisone interaction (increases prednisone levels).\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Build & Deploy \"The Cartu Method\" Website**: `cartu.rasputin.studio`.\n2. **Package OpenClaw Compaction Plugin**: Make it downloadable from the site.\n3. **Wait for Josh's Review of Manus Spec**: Do not start Stage 1 build until greenlit.\n4. **Monitor Dad's Recovery**: Check back in 2-3 weeks re: hospital release and Tai Chi.\n5. **Sasha to send Apostilled Marriage Cert**: Once obtained, forward to Chloe at Almond Blossoms.\n6. **Thursday 09:00 MSK**: Remind Josh of surgeon appointment.\n7. **Continue Pipeline Monitoring**: Daily reports at 08:00 MSK.\n\n## Critical Context\n- **Dad (Lazar)**: Toronto Western Hospital. Fungal infection (pulmonary). Treatment: Voriconazole. Interaction warning: Voriconazole increases Prednisone levels.\n- **Medical**: Surgeon appointment **Thu Feb 20, 09:00 MSK**. Suspected umbilical hernia.\n- **Brazilian Regulation**: Draft SIGAP rules leaked. Cura\u00e7ao operators need license by Q3 2026. Cost ~$5M. Not a fire drill.\n- **Compaction**: Gemini 3 Flash is ~18s for compaction (vs 4 min for Opus). Speed is the bottleneck.\n- **IVF**: Marriage certificate needs Apostille from Russian Ministry of Justice (Moscow) before Almond Blossoms can proceed.\n- **Pipeline**: All 6 providers active. Antigravity proxy restored on port 4152.\n- **Star Citizen**: Handle `jcartu`. Legatus Navium. $34k spent.\n- **Extradition Law Firm (ELF)**: Contact info found, but outreach **HELD**.\n- **Josh's US Indictment**: Case No. 8:21-cr-00331-PX (D. Md.).\n- **Manus Competitor**: Architecture spec sent. Stack: Next.js 15, FastAPI, LangGraph, Qdrant, Ollama.\n- **OpenCode Black**: $200/mo flat. Verified working at `opencode.ai/zen/v1/messages`. 1st Fallback.",
