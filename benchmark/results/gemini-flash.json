  "summary": "## Goal\n1. Review and discuss Josh's health/biohacking stack, especially MOTS-c peptide history and current protocol\n2. Plan and execute IVF logistics with Almond Blossoms (Dubai) + Orchid Health (NJ) for embryo genetic screening\n3. Draft legal documents required by Almond Blossoms clinic for IVF without Josh physically present\n4. Investigate Rivalry Corp (TSXV: RVLY) \u2014 Canadian esports betting operator in distress/selling\n5. Monitor iGaming M&A market for buy/sell opportunities relevant to Josh's grey-market operation\n6. Analyze latest Grok social intel signals and translate them into actionable business moves\n7. Security audit and hardening of OpenClaw gateway + Rasputin server infrastructure\n8. Investigate potential umbilical hernia / diastasis recti \u2014 book surgeon appointment\n9. Diagnose OpenClaw gateway pipeline behavior \u2014 rate limiting, model switching/failover frequency, cron lane health\n10. Set up gog OAuth for josh@cartu.com and enable all Google Workspace APIs for full CLI access\n11. Check Google AI subscriptions on josh@cartu.com and j@mail99.me; configure Antigravity provider for free Claude Opus access\n12. Deep-dive all Opus 4.6 provider rate limits and optimize pipeline fallback order\n13. Set up Opus pipeline monitoring observatory \u2014 probe every 30 min, daily morning report, optimize for 1 week (Feb 17-24)\n14. Star Citizen account evaluation \u2014 help Josh with RSI hangar valuation / account details\n15. **Research tai chi classes/instructors in Toronto for Dad (Lazar) post-lung transplant** \u2014 both studio classes and in-home instructors, ideally with post-surgical/respiratory rehab experience. PINNED until Lazar is a few days from hospital release.\n16. **Build production-quality Manus competitor for Russian/CIS market** \u2014 architecture for millions, ship for 5 users. NOT a hack/Frankenstein of existing pieces. Build once, scale later. Use parallel OpenCode + Claude Code + sub-agents + local GPU inference to build in ~5-7 days.\n17. **Draft outreach to Extradition Law Firm (ELF)** for Interpol Red Notice defense + Russian residency protection\n18. **Resolve \u0412\u041d\u0416 (blue book) conversion** \u2014 convert old-format (2028 expiration) permanent residence permit to new indefinite format via migration lawyer (Tarasenko)\n19. **Evaluate Ashley McDonald's Rasputin Production architecture** \u2014 production-grade affiliate platform already in repo, assess readiness for deployment on existing K3s cluster\n20. **Fix Grok intel scan deduplication** \u2014 scanner delivers same digest 3x/day without diffing against previously delivered content\n21. **Investigate OpenClaw adaptive thinking support** \u2014 determine whether OpenClaw 2026.2.15 translates `thinkingDefault: \"high\"` to new Anthropic adaptive thinking API format (`thinking: {type: \"adaptive\"}` + `output_config: {effort}`) or still uses deprecated `budget_tokens`\n22. **Fix OpenCode Black as OpenClaw provider/fallback** \u2014 configure proper provider definition and verify working as pipeline fallback\n23. **Run full 20-category Grok social intel scan** \u2014 all forums/topics across casino regulation, brand monitoring, affiliate/traffic, payments, player sentiment, new markets, M&A, AI, crypto, geopolitics, cars, health, gaming, luxury, gadgets, audio, Russia/expat, VR/XR\n24. **Develop \"The Cartu Method\" \u2014 a website, beautiful, modern design. Show the research, the benchmarks, the plugin. Make it look professional but not corporate. Like a tech research lab vibe. Host it on rasputin.to or rasputin.studio.**\n25. **Benchmark local and cloud models for context compaction** \u2014 Qwen 72B, Qwen Coder 30B, Gemini Flash, Gemini Pro, Sonnet\n\n## Constraints & Preferences\n- Josh cannot travel internationally (Interpol Red Notice \u2014 binary options fraud case)\n- Legal documents must NOT reference criminal matters, Interpol, or specific jurisdictions \u2014 keep vague (\"ongoing legal proceedings\")\n- Sasha doesn't want to do IVF in Mexico (Orchid's other international option)\n- Josh's sperm is stored at NGC Clinic, St. Petersburg, Russia \u2014 export restrictions and sanctions complicate shipping\n- Josh operates grey-market iGaming brands (WikiLuck, BetOBet, 24Slots, BattleBet, Pure Casino, Peer Casino \u2014 INSINE KFT/NewEra B.V., Cura\u00e7ao licensed)\n- **Brazil is NOT a primary market** \u2014 focus is English-speaking grey markets (Canada, NZ, India, Northern Europe likely). Need casino admin panel access to verify player geo/language breakdown.\n- **No SecureClaw install** \u2014 Josh rejected the Adversa AI third-party security tool; manual hardening preferred over behavioral context tax\n- Server is behind NAT (192.168.1.94, router 192.168.1.1) \u2014 public IP 193.186.162.74 shows ports filtered; LAN exposure only, not internet exposure\n- Only Josh's wife has WiFi access \u2014 LAN attack surface is minimal\n- **gog keyring**: file backend, `GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD=***PASSWORD_REDACTED***`, `GOG_ACCOUNT=josh@cartu.com` (both exported in `~/.bashrc`)\n- **OAuth client \"Second Brain Health\"** is set to **Internal** user type \u2014 only cartu.com org users can auth. Does NOT support classroom, chat, cloud-platform, contacts.other.readonly, or directory.readonly scopes.\n- **Morning briefing preference**: Josh wants pipeline health monitoring delivered as part of his morning casino updates \u2014 NOT as separate alerts. Bundle all into one morning shot.\n- **Pipeline cost priority**: Flat-fee subs first (Max20, OpenCode Black \u2014 already paying), then free (Antigravity), then per-token last. anthropic-direct is absolute worst case (\"costs a fortune\").\n- **.env file keys are STALE** \u2014 auth-profiles.json (`/home/josh/.openclaw/agents/main/agent/auth-profiles.json`) is the real source of truth for API keys. `.env` ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and OPENROUTER_API_KEY differ from auth-profiles.\n- **Rewrite tone preference**: When drafting messages for Josh to send to his brothers, write as one paragraph, no dashes (\u2014), no AI-style formatting. Older brother telling younger brothers how it is.\n- **Manus competitor: build once, scale later** \u2014 Architecture decisions that are impossible to change later (tenant isolation, event protocol, API contract, stateless backend, interface-based services) must be right from day 1. Everything else (monitoring, CI/CD, CDN, rate limiting, billing) can wait.\n- **Manus competitor: $0 build + $0 run** \u2014 OpenCode Black ($200/mo flat, already paying) for build. Ollama Qwen 72B + Coder 30B on GPUs for product inference. Zero per-token API costs.\n- **Grey-market regulatory news is NOT a fire drill** \u2014 worth a mention in intel digests, not \ud83d\udea8 red alerts with action items. Josh knows he's grey, always has been. Curacao blocks are \"just Tuesday.\"\n- **Don't repeat the same analysis/intel multiple times in one day** \u2014 Josh explicitly called this out 3 times. Grok scanner dedup must be fixed.\n\n## Progress\n### Done\n- [x] Reviewed MOTS-c history, mechanisms, and Josh's previous dosing (28mg/week, 3-4x standard)\n- [x] Updated Josh's health profile: new stack is TB-500, BPC-157, Somatropin 1iu/day, TRT 10mg/day (~70mg/week), Mounjaro 7.5mg/week \u2014 committed to memory\n- [x] Confirmed Josh & Sasha married January 14, 2026 in Moscow \u2014 committed to memory\n- [x] Assessed fertility impact of 2 weeks back on TRT \u2014 pipeline sperm still viable, not yet fully suppressed\n- [x] Confirmed 6 portions of sperm banked; IVF target April 2027 cycle (late March/early April retrieval)\n- [x] Drafted legal restrictions letter \u2192 `/home/josh/.openclaw/workspace/drafts/almond-blossoms-legal-restriction-letter.md`\n- [x] Drafted notarized consent letter \u2192 `/home/josh/.openclaw/workspace/drafts/almond-blossoms-consent-letter.md`\n- [x] Sent both drafts to Josh via Telegram (messages 10922, 10923 to chat 1031217602)\n- [x] Researched Russia\u2192Dubai sperm shipping options (IVF Couriers hand-carry service, Sasha hand-carry as backup)\n- [x] Researched Russia\u2192US embryo biopsy shipping \u2014 confirmed near-impossible\n- [x] Identified Rivalry Corp (TSXV: RVLY) winding down operations as of Feb 13, 2026\n- [x] Committed M&A monitoring directive to memory\n- [x] Analyzed latest Grok intel scans and mapped signals to Josh's operation\n- [x] Confirmed OpenClaw version 2026.2.15 (latest on stable channel)\n- [x] Ran `openclaw status` \u2014 built-in security audit found **3 CRITICAL + 2 WARN + 1 INFO** issues\n- [x] Retrieved full gateway configuration via `gateway config.get`\n- [x] Researched Adversa AI / SecureClaw \u2014 recommended against installing\n- [x] **OpenClaw security hardening \u2014 all 6 priority fixes applied** (chmod 700, Telegram allowFrom locked, elevated exec locked, trustedProxies fixed, Discord disabled, API key moved to .env)\n- [x] **Phase 1 server hardening \u2014 internal services bound to localhost:** Second brain (7777), Embedding server (8003), Reranker (8006 already ok), ttyd (7681 \u2014 **CRITICAL: was exposing bash shell on 0.0.0.0 with plaintext creds**), ADB (5037 killed)\n- [x] **Full Rasputin server audit completed**: 58 services on 0.0.0.0 inventoried.

Draft shown to Josh for approval.\n- [x] **Retrieved and analyzed Ashley McDonald's Rasputin Production architecture** \u2014 fetched full doc via `gog docs cat`, saved to `/home/josh/.openclaw/workspace/reference/rasputin-production-ashley-spec.md`.\n- [x] **Confirmed Ashley's repo exists and is active** \u2014 Bitbucket Server at `git.shuhari.tools/projects/RAS/repos/workspace/browse` (behind SSO). Commits by Ashley McDonald on Jan 9-10, 2026.\n- [x] **Confirmed Rick = Ashley McDonald** \u2014 Rick (@rick_the_alien, rick@mail99.me) is Ashley McDonald, Josh's CTO\n- [x] **Provided architecture analysis to Josh** \u2014 PostgREST and event outbox pattern praised, concerns raised about missing AI layer, K8s operational overhead, Knative premature for current scale, no CI/CD/timeline in spec\n- [x] **Clarified Tarasenko is migration lawyer, not developer** \u2014 Josh needs him for \u0412\u041d\u0416 blue book conversion, not Rasputin platform\n- [x] **Recommended Tarasenko for \u0412\u041d\u0416 conversion** \u2014 cheaper than ELF for administrative procedure, keep ELF as backup if \u041c\u0412\u0414 flags Red Notice\n- [x] **Confirmed Opus 4.6 already has adaptive thinking** \u2014 launched with it on Feb 5, 2026. Sonnet 4.6 also dropped today (Feb 17). Josh's config has `thinking=high` which locks to max; adaptive would let model decide per-request.\n- [x] **Researched Anthropic adaptive thinking API** \u2014 new format: `thinking: {type: \"adaptive\"}` + `output_config: {effort: \"medium\"|\"low\"|\"high\"|\"max\"}`. Old `budget_tokens` is deprecated on Opus 4.6/Sonnet 4.6. `max` effort is Opus 4.6 only.\n- [x] **Pipeline monitoring Day 1 data analysis COMPLETED** \u2014 72 probes over 8 hours (Feb 17, 15:17-23:18 MSK). Results: anthropic-direct 17/18 up (1 \"Overloaded\"), avg 2,931ms; openrouter 18/18 up, avg 3,027ms; opencode-zen 0/18 (16 down + 2 auth err); google-antigravity 0/18 (proxy not running).\n- [x] **Confirmed Antigravity proxy not running** \u2014 all 18 probes show \"proxy not running\" on port 4152. Free Opus access sitting idle.\n- [x] **Retrieved OpenClaw system status** \u2014 running on Linux with 86 active sessions, Telegram and WhatsApp channels enabled, default model claude-opus-4-6\n- [x] **Retrieved full openclaw.json config** \u2014 confirmed `opencode/claude-opus-4-6` was first fallback (aliased \"Zen Opus\") in both main agent and subagent fallback chains\n- [x] **Confirmed OpenCode provider misconfiguration in openclaw.json** \u2014 previously no `opencode` provider defined in `models.providers` section, just a dangling model entry\n- [x] **Spawned full 20-category Grok social intel scan** \u2014 sub-agent running all topics: casino regulation, brand monitoring, affiliate/traffic, payments, player sentiment, new markets, M&A, AI models, agents, GPU inference, crypto, geopolitics, cars, health/biohacking, gaming, luxury, gadgets, audio, Russia/expat, VR/XR\n- [x] **MAJOR CORRECTION: OpenCode Black API ACTUALLY WORKS as external endpoint** \u2014 Previous investigation tested WRONG URLs (`opencode.ai/api/v1/`, `api.opencode.ai/v1/`). The correct endpoint is `https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/messages` (Anthropic Messages API format). Confirmed working: HTTP 200, valid Opus 4.6 response, cost $0 (flat rate). 33 models available.\n- [x] **OpenCode Black rate limits researched**: $200/mo 20X plan provides ~$200+/week worth of Opus usage; users report 6-8hr/day of heavy coding for a full week before hitting weekly cap. Weekly quota reset. **~8-10x more capacity than Antigravity.**\n- [x] **Antigravity rate limits confirmed**: ~5 hours of Opus before quota hit, weekly cooldown (users locked out for full weeks). Google tightening limits since Jan 2026.\n- [x] **OpenCode provider PROPERLY configured in openclaw.json** \u2014 added `opencode` provider definition with `baseUrl: \"https://opencode.ai/zen/v1\"`, `api: \"anthropic-messages\"`, API key from env. Model `opencode/claude-opus-4-6` now routes correctly.\n- [x] **New pipeline fallback order APPLIED via gateway config**:\n  1. Max20 (primary)\n  2. OpenCode Black (1st fallback) \u2014 $200/mo flat, ~8-10x Antigravity capacity\n  3. Antigravity (2nd fallback) \u2014 free, ~5hr/week\n  4. OpenRouter (3rd fallback) \u2014 per-token $15/$75\n  5. anthropic-direct (4th fallback) \u2014 per-token, last resort\n  6. Sonnet 4.6 (5th fallback) \u2014 downgrade\n- [x] **OpenCode Zen endpoint fully verified**: `opencode.ai/zen/v1/messages` with Black API key, 33 models, Opus 4.6 at ~2,616ms latency, cost $0\n- [x] **Fixed Antigravity proxy**: Restarted `google-antigravity-proxy` on port 4152. Confirmed live with HTTP 200 health check and test call.\n- [x] **Sent Sasha instructions for apostille of marriage certificate** via WhatsApp.\n- [x] **Set reminder for Thursday surgeon appointment**.\n- [x] **Pulled Dexcom G7 data via ADB**, analyzed last 7 days.\n- [x] **Recommended Mounjaro timing adjustment** to cover lunch spikes.\n- [x] **Deployed Grok scanner dedup fix**: Added diff check to `/home/josh/.openclaw/workspace/tools/grok_social_intel.py` to only surface new items.\n- [x] Sent SPEC.md to Telegram.\n\n### In Progress\n- [ ] **Investigating OpenClaw adaptive thinking translation** \u2014 searching OpenClaw 2026.2.15 dist JS files (`image-B1DRN441.js`, `reply-BhWxw1_E.js`, `cron-cli-CeKWtNhW.js`, `gateway-cli-CRiBIFy7.js`) to determine whether `thinkingDefault: \"high\"` gets translated to new adaptive API or deprecated `budget_tokens`. Josh said \"Yeah check\" to investigate this.\n- [ ] **Manus competitor Phase 0 \u2014 write the bible**: Start SPEC.md, CONTRACTS.md, BUILD_STATE.md, shared schemas, task files. ~2-3 hours. Awaiting Josh's final \"go.\"\n- [ ] **Star Citizen account evaluation** \u2014 Josh confirmed (\"Yep\") he wants help. Hangar data loaded. Next: determine what Josh wants done.\n- [ ] **Week-long pipeline optimization** \u2014 monitoring running, daily analysis + morning reports active. Day 1 baseline captured. Runs through Feb 24. OpenCode Black now properly in pipeline as fallback 1. Antigravity now running.\n- [ ] **Tai chi for Dad (Lazar) \u2014 PINNED** \u2014 waiting for Josh to say \"Dad's coming home\" to pull top 5 Toronto studios + in-home instructors with post-surgical/respiratory rehab experience\n- [ ] **ELF email draft awaiting Josh's confirmation to send** \u2014 draft complete, Josh reviewing\n- [ ] **\u0412\u041d\u0416 blue book conversion** \u2014 Josh needs migration lawyer (Tarasenko) to convert old-format (2028 expiration) permit to indefinite format. Josh hasn't provided Tarasenko's contact info yet.\n- [ ] **Full 20-category Grok scan running** \u2014 sub-agent spawned, compiling results + TL;DR executive summary, auto-announce when done\n- [ ] Josh needs to forward draft documents to his lawyer (Michelle Shapiro at ArentFox Schiff or Israeli counsel)\n- [ ] Rivalry Corp acquisition opportunity \u2014 no financials deep-dive done yet\n- [ ] Casino market analysis correction \u2014 need admin panel access to verify actual player geo/language breakdown\n- [ ] Phase 2 server hardening: Docker compose fixes for PostgreSQL 5432, MySQL 3306 \u2192 bind to 127.0.0.1\n- [ ] Phase 3 server hardening: code-server 3113, OpenCode 9999, Netdata 19999 \u2192 bind to Tailscale IP or add iptables rules\n- [ ] Tailscale SSH enablement: `sudo tailscale set --ssh` then bind SSH to localhost + Tailscale IP only\n- [ ] **Compaction benchmark suite \u2014 local models still grinding, cloud results in**\n- [ ] **Start \"The Cartu Method\" website build**\n- [ ] **Package the compaction offloader plugin for OpenClaw**\n\n### Blocked\n- Casino admin panel access needed \u2014 no URLs or credentials stored on Rasputin; Josh needs to provide admin URL + creds or screenshot geo breakdown\n- Star Citizen RSI login credentials not in memory \u2014 may need Josh to provide if live scrape is needed\n- **jarvis-postgres container broken** \u2014 `database \"jarvis\" does not exist` / `role \"postgres\" does not exist`. Real creds: DB=`jarvis_vault`, user=`jarvis`, password=`***REDACTED***`. Needs fix before ALFIE backend can connect to Postgres. (~30 min fix)\n- **Tarasenko contact info unknown** \u2014 Josh hasn't provided who Tarasenko is or how to reach them\n- **git.shuhari.tools requires SSO auth** \u2014 can't audit Ashley's repo code quality without read access\n\n## Key Decisions\n- **Dubai over Mexico/Russia for IVF**: Almond Blossoms is confirmed Orchid partner, logistics sorted, only legal letter needed\n- **Keep legal disclosure vague**: \"Ongoing legal proceedings\" only \u2014 no Interpol/criminal references\n- **Stay on TRT**: 6 banked sperm portions sufficient for ICSI\n- **Michelle Shapiro recommended** over Israeli lawyer for the legal letter\n- **Don't install SecureClaw**: Manual hardening preferred \u2014 behavioral skill conflicts with autonomy-first config\n- **Don't change sandbox.mode or elevatedDefault**: Both intentionally set by Josh\n- **Security postponed to tomorrow morning**: Phase 1 complete, Phases 2-3 deferred\n- **Brazil licensing deprioritized**: Not a primary market. Focus on English-speaking grey markets.\n- **josh@cartu.com is the primary email**: Not j@mail99.me \u2014 gog configured for cartu.com\n- **Manual OAuth token exchange over gog interactive flow**: gog's PTY-based `--manual` auth kept failing. Direct curl token exchange + `gog auth tokens import` worked reliably.\n- **Gmail-only initial auth, incremental scope expansion**: `--services all` caused invalid_scope. Started with Gmail, adding incrementally.\n- **Google AI Ultra NOT worth investigating**: Consumer subscription for Gemini web UI, does NOT include free API access.\n- **Pipeline cost ordering: flat-fee first, free second, per-token last**: Max20 ($200/mo) \u2192 OpenCode Black ($200/mo) \u2192 Antigravity (free) \u2192 OpenRouter (per-token) \u2192 anthropic-direct (per-token, absolute last resort).\n- **OpenCode is \"Black\" tier ($200/mo), not free \"Zen\"**: Josh clarified he has the paid subscription.\n- **j@mail99.me for Antigravity, not josh@cartu.com**: j@mail99.me is the account with the Antigravity subscription.\n- **Antigravity uses `claude-opus-4-6-thinking` model ID**: The non-thinking `claude-opus-4-6` returns 404 on Antigravity.\n- **Manus competitor: build properly from scratch, not hack existing pieces together**: Josh explicitly rejected wiring ALFIE UI + ALFIE backend + Russian Manus orchestrator. Wants clean architecture built for millions, MVP for 5.\n- **Manus competitor: architecture for millions, ship for 5**: Day-1 decisions that can't change later: tenant isolation, event protocol schema, API contract, stateless backend, interface-based services. Day-N swaps: Docker\u2192K8s, local disk\u2192S3, Ollama\u2192vLLM, JWT\u2192OAuth/SSO, direct WebSocket\u2192Redis Streams.\n- **Manus competitor stack**: Next.js 15 + shadcn/ui + Tailwind + Zustand (frontend), FastAPI (backend), LangGraph (orchestrator), PostgreSQL (event-sourced sessions), Qdrant (per-user vector memory), Redis (cache/pubsub), Docker (sandbox per session), Ollama (Qwen 72B + Coder 30B).\n- **Strip enterprise bloat from Russian Manus for MVP**: No Keycloak, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, OTel, MinIO. Simple JWT auth + file storage on disk.\n- **Layered sequential build over parallel waves**: Deep reassessment concluded parallel agents are bad at integration (\"the glue IS the product\"). 4 sequential stages, each using 3-4 parallel agents with manual integration between stages.\n- **Keep Russian Manus backend, rebuild frontend from scratch**: Backend LangGraph orchestrator is solid and will be extended. Frontend rebuilt as clean split-screen Manus UX.\n- **Realistic timeline: 5-7 days for working MVP, not 24 hours**: Integration, debugging, frontend polish, and WebSocket streaming reliability are hard problems that can't be parallelized.\n- **Filesystem-as-memory for multi-day multi-agent build**: SPEC.md, BUILD_STATE.md, CONTRACTS.md, decisions/, tasks/, shared/, logs/.\n- **Local inference for CIS prototype**: Ollama Qwen 72B + Qwen Coder 30B on existing GPUs, $0/mo per-user cost.\n- **Per-user Qdrant isolation needed**: Current `second_brain_v2` is one big collection \u2014 each prototype user needs own namespace or collection.\n- **$20-35 total build cost**: Leveraging OpenCode Black flat, Claude Code ~$5-10, Qwen 72B $0.\n- **Use Tarasenko (migration lawyer) for \u0412\u041d\u0416 conversion, not ELF**: Administrative document swap at \u041c\u0412\u0414 doesn't need extradition rates. ELF is backup if \u041c\u0412\u0414 flags the Red Notice.\n- **Use Ashley's existing repo, don't rebuild with Tarasenko**: Ashley has the Rasputin Production codebase in a working repo with active commits (Jan 9-10, 2026), battle-tested pg-event-publisher, and designed the architecture.\n- **Rasputin Production \u2260 Manus competitor**: These are two separate projects.\n- **Regulatory intel calibration**: Mention regulatory moves in digests but don't treat them as fire drills.\n- **Grok scanner needs dedup logic**: Must diff new scans against last delivered content and only surface genuinely new signals.\n- **OpenCode Black IS a valid pipeline fallback**: Previous investigation was WRONG \u2014 tested incorrect URLs. The correct endpoint `https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/messages` (Anthropic Messages API) works with the Black API key. HTTP 200, cost $0, 33 models available. Previous conclusion (\"CLI-only, no external API\") was erroneous.\n- **OpenCode Black positioned as 1st fallback (above Antigravity)**: ~8-10x more Opus capacity than Antigravity. Weekly quota vs Antigravity's ~5hr/week. Josh confirmed: \"we'll have higher limits with OpenCode Black.\"\n- **Antigravity demoted to 3rd in fallback chain**: Josh said \"put that third in line for now\" \u2014 lower capacity (~5hr/week), Google tightening limits.\n- **Hold Star Citizen account**: Don't care about selling it. More curious than anything.\n- **Use smaller, faster models for compaction**: A 7-14B model purpose-tuned for summarization could hit 150-200 tok/s.\n- **Reduce output size for compaction**: Compress the summary format, 6K tokens instead of 12K = half the time.\n- **Two-stage compaction**: Fast local model for immediate compaction, then background Opus sweep for quality.\n- **\"The Cartu Method\"**: A systematic evaluation framework for context compaction in AI agent systems.\n- **Compaction Quality Triad**: Speed (time to compact), Fidelity (information retention %), Efficiency (context window utilization).\n- **Decoupled Architecture for Compaction**: Compaction is infrastructure, not conversation. It should run on infrastructure-grade models (fast, cheap, reliable) not conversation-grade models (smart, nuanced, expensive).\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Verify Antigravity proxy on port 4152** \u2014 free Opus access still idle, probe shows \"proxy not running.\" May need OpenClaw gateway restart or plugin re-auth for the external probe to detect it. Internal OpenClaw plugin IS working.\n2. **Fix pipeline probe to also test Max20 primary AND OpenCode Zen** \u2014 currently only tests fallbacks, missing the two most important providers.\n3. **Complete OpenClaw adaptive thinking investigation** \u2014 finish analyzing dist JS files to determine if `thinkingDefault: \"high\"` maps to new adaptive API or deprecated `budget_tokens`.\n4. **Get Tarasenko contact info from Josh** \u2014 need to know who they are, how to reach them, draft outreach for \u0412\u041d\u0416 conversion\n5. **Await Josh's confirmation on ELF email draft** \u2014 ready to send to info@extraditionlaw.net when Josh says go\n6. **Manus competitor Phase 0 \u2014 write the bible**: Start SPEC.md, CONTRACTS.md, BUILD_STATE.md, shared schemas, task files. ~2-3 hours. Awaiting Josh's final \"go.\"\n7. **Manus competitor Stages 1-4** (Days 1-7): Multi-user chat \u2192 agent mode \u2192 split-screen UX \u2192 hardening\n8. **Get Ashley read access to git.shuhari.tools** \u2014 audit actual code quality of Rasputin Production repo\n9. **IVF documents next steps**: Josh fills in passport numbers + Sasha's maiden name \u2192 notary \u2192 apostille \u2192 forward to lawyer\n10. **Star Citizen**: Clarify with Josh what he wants done\n11. **Continue pipeline monitoring (Feb 17-24)**: Daily analysis, morning reports at 08:00 MSK. Focus on Max20 rate limiting patterns, OpenCode Zen capacity under real load, Anthropic overload frequency, OpenRouter latency stability.\n12. **Tomorrow morning**: Phase 2+3 server hardening \u2014 Docker database binding, code-server/OpenCode binding, Tailscale SSH\n13. **Tomorrow morning**: Scrub credential leaks from memory files \u2014 `memory/2026-02-07.md` line 242, `memory/god_stack_research.md` line 385\n14. Investigate cron lane 403 errors (11:00 and 12:00 today)\n15. **When Dad (Lazar) is near release**: Pull top 5 tai chi studios in Toronto + private in-home instructors\n16. Josh provides casino admin panel URL + credentials \u2192 verify actual player geo/language breakdown\n17. Josh forwards draft letters to lawyer \u2192 get on letterhead + notarized/apostilled\n18. Sasha books appointment with \u0445\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0440\u0433-\u0433\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433 for Josh's suspected umbilical hernia\n19. Obtain apostille for marriage certificate (Russian ZAGS document \u2192 Ministry of Justice)\n20. Submit documents to Almond Blossoms (Chloe Meriel B Duran)\n21. Coordinate sperm transport from NGC SPb \u2192 Almond Blossoms Dubai\n22. Sasha baseline bloods (AMH, Day 2-3 scan) if not already done\n23. Deep-dive Rivalry Corp financials if Josh wants to pursue acquisition\n24. Run full compaction benchmark suite \u2014 local and cloud models\n25. Start \"The Cartu Method\" website build\n26. Package the compaction offloader plugin for OpenClaw\n27. Get Dad's",
